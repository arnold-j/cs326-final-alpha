##Innovative Idea

A website that will host baking competitions. There will be a given recipe for each competition and users can upload pictures of what they baked. Other users can then vote on which person baked the best looking version of that recipe. There will also be a section for user's tips and tricks / questions people have about the recipe. The idea is to bring bakers together and let them learn from others' successes and mistakes.

Veterans and novices to baking alike can try their hand at weekly and/or daily baking recipe challenges that will be user generated and voted on. During our time in quarantine it would be fun to pick up a new skill and to practice in the comfort of oneâ€™s own home while comparing their creations with others.

No similar website exists. There are similar things online, but they are all on facebook groups or similar platforms.
